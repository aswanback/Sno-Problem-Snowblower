# Sno-Problem-Snowblower
This was a senior design project in May 2023

The Sno-Problem-Snowblower is a fully autonomous snowblower designed for consumer use. It has a manual mode, a remote control mode, and a fully autonomous mode, utilizing a mobile app for control. 

This code is the source for a ROS package that controls all aspects of the onboard computing. It was unfortunately recovered as a backup due to a hardware failure so it was uploaded as a single commit.
